# Reactive TCP Server with Spring Example

Sets up a Reactive TCP server with Spring Boot.

To run the project locally use the following Maven command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then you can query at [http://localhost:8080/entity](http://localhost:8080/entity), or use the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

## Features

The project by default comes with a useful series of features:

- Preconfigured POM to begin developing a new library fast.
- Prepared for [Github Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows), including configuration files and deployment scripts. Check the [Archetype documentation](https://docs.bernardomg.com/maven/spring-web-service-maven-archetype) to find out more.
- Unit and integration tests suites ready to be run with [JUnit](http://junit.org) just by using the Maven test and verify commands.
- A Maven site, using the [Docs Maven Skin](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin), to contain the documentation, the Javadocs and several reports.
- A bunch of useful files, such as readme, gitignore and gitattributes.

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
